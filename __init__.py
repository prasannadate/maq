"""
Adiabatic Quantum Artificial Intelligence (AQAI, pronounced "A-KAI") is a 
repository of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that run 
on adiabatic quantum computers like D-Wave 2000Q. It also contains utility 
algorithms like an efficient embedding algorithm for embedding quadratic 
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on D-Wave quantum computers.
